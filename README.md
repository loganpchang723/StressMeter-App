# StressMeter App

This is an Android App developed to track the user's current stress level. The app has a built-in vibrating and audible alarm that triggers the app to open when the user unlocks their phone. The user is presented with an array of 16 images and is prompted to select which image best corresponds to their current stress level. The user can scroll between several pages of images. Upon selecting an image, the user's stress level is recorded and the app closes. The user can see a tabular and graphical representation of their selected stress levels in the app as well.
